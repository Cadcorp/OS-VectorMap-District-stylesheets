# OS VectorMap District Full Colour style

These are QML files for OS VectorMap District in ESRI Shapefile format for use in QGIS.

*They have been designed to work with the data as it is supplied.*

## Quick start guide

**1.**  Fork or [download](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/OS-VectorMap-District-stylesheets/archive/master.zip) the contents of this repository

**2.**  Copy the font file 'OS_VMDistrict.otf' into your systems font directory (on Windows machines this is (C:\Windows\Fonts)

*Your machine may require a restart for QGIS to recognise this new font*

**3.**  Load your OS VectorMap District ESRI Shapefile data into QGIS

**4.**  Double click on a layer to access the 'Layer Properties' window > click on 'Load Style...' > navigate to the directory containing the QML files (those ending .qml) > select the QML file that corresponds to that layer > click 'Open' > click 'OK'

*Repeat step 4 for all layers*

**5.**  Although every feature is styled, for use as a contextual map we recommend the following layer order and visibility:

We recommend viewing the map between **1:10,000** and **1:25,000** for maximum legibility

Your map should now look similar to this:
